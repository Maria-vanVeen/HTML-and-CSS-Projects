			<blockquote cite="https://www.cellobello.org/cello-blog/performance/back-to-the-breath-mindfulness-for-cellists/">While we are all facing a new reality with the Covid-19 pandemic spreading all over the globe, our way of experiencing life has taken on a new reality in the present moment. Each day, we are presented with innumerable challenges, from following the sobering news on TV and social media, being bombarded with worries, anxiety and panic about what is next to come in your country, your city, within yourself and for your loved ones. It is important to create a positive outlet in the midst of this uncertain time. As a musician and cellist, you have a way to create a positive outlet by playing the cello. Another positive outlet is to quiet the mind through breathing exercises and meditation.

			<h3>Cello poem</h3>
			<h2>Strings of my Cello</h2>
			<p>
				Never once had I played the cello.<br>
				I thought the violin sounded much more lovely.<br>
				<br>
				And then I saw you.<br>
				No... I heard you.<br>
				Such a mysterious sound.<br>
				Inviting.<br>
				<br>
				You drew me in with your tunes of promise.<br>
				You tempted my loneliness with a single flick of a string.
